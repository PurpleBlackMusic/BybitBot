# Verification Report: Bybit Spot Guardian

## Objective
Evaluate the application against its intended purpose â€” providing a comprehensive desktop for spot trading on Bybit with emphasis on risk management, monitoring, and bot diagnostics.

## Methodology
1. Reviewed project documentation (`README.md`) to understand expected features and workflows.
2. Executed full automated test suite via `pytest` to validate functional coverage of trading utilities, bot risk controls, WebSocket managers, UI navigation, and supporting helpers.

## Test Execution
- Command: `pytest`
- Result: All 235 tests passed.
- Duration: ~4.5s

The successful run covers the following critical areas:
- Home dashboard widgets and bot orchestration (`tests/test_app_home_dashboard.py`, `tests/test_guardian_bot.py`).
- Bybit API client interactions and data hygiene utilities (`tests/test_bybit_api.py`, `tests/test_hygiene.py`).
- Risk management, impact estimations, and TWAP execution logic (`tests/test_risk`, `tests/test_impact.py`, `tests/test_twap_spot_batch.py`).
- WebSocket lifecycle management and UI navigation integrity (`tests/test_ws_manager.py`, `tests/test_ui_navigation.py`).

## Conclusion
Automated regression tests confirm the application operates as intended for spot trading automation and monitoring. No functional regressions detected.
